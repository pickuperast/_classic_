Stay away from the dirt mounds in front of the temple as undeads will spawn near them, it's better to wait until Infiltrator Hameya patrols up front for you to take on alone.  Also he hits hard so be prepared.

This quest may be hard to solo.  If you are almost lvl 57, then grind to it before doing this quest.  You may need to distract the mobs in the lodge, grab the book and run out some how.  If you cannot solo this, or find help then it can be skipped.
07) Go west to Plaguewood (starting at 46.34) and do the following 3 quests together:

05) Go through the long cave (entrance at 15.29).  NOTES:  This cave journey is not easy.  There is a lvl 60 elite spider  /target (with a 12 hour respawn) that patrols back and forth to the 2 entrances of this cave.  Try to sneak past it if you can.  If this cave is too hard for you, then another possible quick alternative is to take the Tower Gryphon ride from the Plaguewood Tower (22.32) to the Crown Guard Tower (39.75), as long as the horde has control over the towers that is.  Make sure you get all 30 Crypt Fiend Parts before leaving this area.
06) Once you get out to the other side of the cave (or take the tower ride), north along Thondoril River at Tiron Fordring (8.44), turn in "Demon Dogs [QT5542-]" "Blood Tinged Skies [QT5543-]" and "Carrion Grubbage [QT5544-]".

Only accept, do and turn in "Duskwing, Oh How I Hate Thee...", if you are able to kill/loot Duskwing /target.  This lvl 60 Elite bat patrols just above The Marris Stead.  With the help of a few other players you could be able to do this.  Same thing with "The Corpulent One", Borelgore /target (lvl 60 Elite, around 58.32).
08) Go south to The Undercroft, go down in the crypt and then do "Zaeldarr the Outcast [QC6021-]": kill/loot Zaeldarr the Outcast (27.85).  (See Video)
09) Behind the crypt, next to the wooden wagon, click on the Mound of Dirt to turn in "Hameya's Plea [QT6024-]" (28.86).
10) Next to you, do "Of Forgotten Memories [QC5781-]": click on the Loose Dirt Mound (28.87) that is next to Tirion Fordring's Grave, then kill/loot Mercutio Filthgorger (he has 3 bodyguards).  IMPORTANT TIP:  These mobs spawn between the two dirt mounds (from the previous step).  Mercutio Filthgorger spawns in first, then his bodyguards soon after.  So act fast and immediately pull Mercutio Filthgorger away from his spawn point to avoid fighting his guards too, as this fight can be really tough to do solo without this tactic.

01) Go NW to Tiron Fordring, (8.44) and turn in "Of Forgotten Memories [QT5781-]", accept "Of Lost Honor [QA5845-]".

06) You should be friendly now with The Argent Dawn, if so:  Right in front of the Inn's Entrance, go to Rayne and with your 30 Savage Fronds (in the mailbox?) accept and turn in "Savage Fronds [QT9136-]" (81.59).
07) Also (if you are friendly with The Argent Dawn):  Go in the Inn and in the back from the human with black hair (82.58), accept and turn in "Binding the Dreadnaught [QT9131-]" (requires the 30 Dark Iron Scraps, that could be in your mailbox).  Also in the Inn, with your 30 Crypt Fiend Parts, accept and turn in "Cryptstalker Armor Doesn't Make Itself... [QT9124-]"
08) Go north a bit more in Light's Hope Chapel and turn in (if you did it) "When Smokey Sings, I Get Violent [QT6041-]" (81.58).  If you turned this in, you can then destroy Smokey's Special Compound.

Also, turn in (if you still need to) "Luck Be With You [QT969-]".
03) Exit Everlook to your right and go to the Wind Rider Master (60.36) and fly to Bloodvenom Post, Felwood.
04) At Bloodvenom Post, turn in "Wild Guardians [QT4741-]", accept the next part [QA4721-].  Also turn in (if you found the item) "Guarding Secrets [QT4882-]", accept the next part [QA4883-].
05) Hearth to Everlook.  Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
06) Go north of Everlook (around 65.21) and do "Wild Guardians [QC4883-]": kill 10 Berserk Owlbeasts.
07) Just west of you do "Chillwind Horns [QC4809-]": kill/loot Chillwind Ravagers.  Once finished, keep grinding until your Hearthstone cooldown is less than 11 minutes.
08) Die on purpose to get back to Everlook.
09) Go to the Wind Rider Master (60.36) and fly to Bloodvenom Post, Felwood.
10) At Bloodvenom Post, turn in "Wild Guardians [QT4883-]".  Also turn in (if you found the item and still need to) "Guarding Secrets [QT4882-]", accept the next part [QA4883-].
11) At Bloodvenom Post, go to the Wind Rider Master (34.54 in Felwood) and fly to Thunder Bluff, Mulgore.
12) Once at TB, go to The Elder Rise to Nara Wildmane and turn in "Guarding Secrets [QT4883-]" (76.32).
13) Hearth to Everlook.  Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
14) In Everlook, from Felnok Steelspring under the blue tent (62.39), turn in "Chillwind Horns [QT4809-]", accept "Return to Tinkee [QA4810-]".  NOTE:  You can turn this in next time you head to Burning Steppes.
15) At this point you should be very close to level 60.  I usually grind the rest of the way to level 60 at the Owl Wing Thicket (entrance at 64.60, #1 on map).  But here is a list of other things you could do instead of the owl grinding:

Here are the things you can do to level from 59-60:
-->  You can go back into Eastern Plaguelands and do the many group quests that you couldn't solo.
-->  You can grind away at mobs in Andorhal to increase your rep with The Argent Dawn.
-->  You can grind away at Deadwood furbolgs up north in Felwood to gain rep with the Timbermaw.
-->  You can do Black Rock Depths Instance and all the quests associated with it.
-->  You can also do Stratholme Instance and all the quests associated with that.
-->  You can simply grind on any mob you like until you hit 60.

CONGRATS ON 60!
