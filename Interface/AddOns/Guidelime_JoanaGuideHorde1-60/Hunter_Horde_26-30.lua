This mob drops an item, which starts "Sharptalon's Claw [QA2-]", accept it.  TIP:  An easy way to kill this mob is to bring his health to a 3rd left, then drag him into the guards at Splintertree Post, they will finish em.
06) Just south of Splintertree Post, do "Ashenvale Outrunners [QC6503-]": kill 9 Ashenvale Outrunners /target.  Hunters, use Track Hidden to find them easier.
07) Go slightly west and do the escort quest "Torek's Assault [QC6544-]" (starts at 68.75): escort Torek /target & his raiders west into the Silverwing Outpost.
08) Go west to Mystral Lake and do "Stonetalon Standstill [QC25-]": kill the Befouled Water Elementals around the lake and discover the gazebo on the small island in the middle of the lake (49.70).  Also, make sure you find and kill/loot Tideress /target, this water elemental patrols around under the lake, he drops an item which starts "The Befouled Element [QA1918-]", accept it.
09) Kill the next mob related to the Ashenvale Hunt: Ursangous /target, this bear patrols clockwise around the mountain and trees (43.67).  He drops an item, which starts "Ursangous's Paw [QA23-]", accept it.
10) Kill the last mob related to the Ashenvale Hunt: Shadumbra /target, this black panther patrols around (57.56).  This cat drops an item, which starts "Shadumbra's Head [QA24-]", accept it.
11) Do "The sacred Flame [QC1195-]".  First kill/loot the Laughing Sisters around Raynewood Retreat (59.55) until you get an Etched Phial (low drop rate), then see next step...
12) Use the quest item Etched Phial at the Moonwell down south (60.73).

02) Right outside the Inn on your left turn in the 3 Ashenvale Hunt quests: "Sharptalon's Claw [QT2-]", "Ursangous's Paw [QT23-]" and "Shadumbra's Head [QT24-]" (74.62).  Then accept and complete "The Hunt Completed [QT247-]".
03) Next to the Inn, turn in "Stonetalon Standstill [QT25-]" and "The Befouled Element [QT1918-]" (74.60), accept "Je'neu of the Earthen Ring [QA824-]".  Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.

07) turn in "Je'neu of the Earthen Ring [QT824-]" (12.34).
08) From the troll up in the other tent, accept "Troll Charm [QA6462-]".
09) From the orc next to the Cauldron accept "Between a Rock and a Thistlefur [QA216-]".
10) Do the escort you previously accepted (if you were able to) "Vorsha the Lasher [QC6641-]": follow and protect Muglash /target until you can click on the Naga Brazier, then after a few waves of Naga mobs, kill Vorsha the Lasher. (See Video).
11) Grind your way to the Thistlefur Hold cave (entrance is 39.31) killing mobs for "Between a Rock and a Thistlefur [QC216-]".  Also, before getting to the cave, make sure Rorgish Jowl /target is dead.  He is a rare mob that patrols around (before the cave entrance) making your future escort quest difficult.  He has a 5.5 hour respawn.
12) In the cave do "Troll Charm [QC6462-]": loot the Troll Chests on the ground..  Then, in the back of the cave, from the white bear in the cage (41.34), accept and try to do the escort quest "Freedom to Ruul [QC6482-]".  You may have to fight 3-5 mobs at once several times, if you fail then it can be skipped.

01) Make sure "Between a Rock and a Thistlefur [QC216-]" is finished, then go back to Zoram Strand and turn in "Vorsha the Lasher [QT6641-]" (12.34).  NOTE:  If you didn't do "Vorsha the Lasher" previously you can try now.

06) At the outskirts of Splintertree Post, turn in "Ashenvale Outrunners [QT6503-]" (71.68).
Hunter, 6a) Just west of Splintertree Post, tame a lvl 27 Ghostpaw Alpha /target to get Bite R4.  Then work your way to the next step:
Hunter, 6b) Abandon your wolf (make sure you have Bite R4 first), then along the river, tame an Elder Ashenvale Bear /target (try to get a lvl 26) to get Claw R4.  Use this bear for the next step:
07) Go up in the building at Raynewood Retreat and try to do "Ordanus [QC1088-]": kill/loot Keeper Ordanus (62.51).  Just kill the guy, grab his head and jump out of there to the right!  Make sure you have enough health to take the fall damage, (See Video).
Hunter, 7a) Go back to Splintertree Post to the Stable Master (73.61, #5 on map), then abandon your bear and get your cat back out and teach him the new abilities.  Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.

02) From the tauren next to the Inn, accept "Bloodfury Bloodline [QA6283-]" (47.61).
03) Go in the Inn next to you and make Sun Rock Retreat your new home from the Innkeeper (48.62).

09) Get your level 28 spells/abilities.  The Hunter Trainers are on The Hunter Rise (59.87).  If you can't afford all of the important ones to get, then I recommend skipping this step.
10) Go to TB's Inn and make Thunder Bluff your new home from the Innkeeper (46.65).
11) If you still need to upgrade to Heavy Wool Bandage (requires First Aid skill 115), then go to the top of The Spirit Rise to the First Aid Trainer (30.21) to get that.

03) REMINDER:  Keep an eye out for the Galak Messenger /target and kill/loot this centaur when you see him in 1k Needles.  He has a very large patrol path.  He drops an item which starts "Assassination Plot [QA4881-]", accept it (if you can).  But, don't intentionally do this yet, continue on with the next step...

10) Once again, if you are still working on "A New Ore Sample [QC1153-]": kill/loot the Gravelsnout Surveyors /target (there are two spawns nearby to check) for the Unrefined Ore Sample (see map for locations, #7 on map).

10) Do "Hypercapacitor Gizmo [QC5151-]" (Elite): clear the mobs around the Panther Cage (23.24), open the cage and kill the lvl 30 elite panther.  Hunters, use immolation trap, fear, wing clip, mend pet, etc. to kill it (See Video).
11) This is your last chance to kill/loot the centuar Galak Messenger /target.  He has a very large patrol path (see map).  He drops an item which starts "Assassination Plot [QA4881-]", accept it.  If you can't find him in time, then skip it along with the follow up quest.

03) Just outside the Inn, turn in "Grimtotem Spying [QT5064-]" and "Wanted - Arnak Grimtotem [QT5147-]" (56.51).  NOTE:  I recommend using the Heavy Armor Kit for these boots and this chest piece.
04) Go to the Wind Rider Master (north in Freewind Post, 45.49) and if you have "A New Ore Sample [QT1153-]" finished fly to Camp Taurajo, The Barrens to turn it in.  Then, (or otherwise) fly to Orgrimmar, Durotar.  NOTE:  Taurens will most likely need to fly to XRs and then run to Orgrimmar.

06) Go in the Inn and make Orgrimmar your new home from the Innkeeper (54.68).

01) Run all the way to Tarren Mill in Hillsbrad Foothills and get the FP there from the Bat Handler (60.19 in Hillsbrad).  You can just bypass the UC for now (no need to get UC's FP yet) and just follow the path shown on the map to get to Hillsbrad.  NOTES:  If you can, use a Swim Speed Potion to cross the lake.  Once you reach Alterac Mountains you can start grinding on some mobs along the way to Tarren Mill.

Work your way toward the next step:
02) South at Nethander Stead (around 64.62) do "Elixir of Agony [QC509-]": loot the Mudsnout Blossoms around the farm.
03) Start working on "Elixir of Pain [QC501-]" (kill/loot cats south and west of the farm) and finish "Elixir of Suffering [QC496-]" (kill/loot bears and spiders, #1 on map).  The Spiders are everywhere, while the bears are more north of the farm along with lower level bears around Tarren Mill.

05) Go in the Inn (bigger house 62.19).  From Christoph Jeffcoat, accept "Soothing Turtle Bisque [QA7321-]" (requires the cooking profession to accept).  From this NPC, buy a Soothing Spices.  Then with your Turtle Meat you farmed earlier, simply turn in the quest right there.
06) Go SW to the yeti cave (46.32) and do "Helcular's Revenge [QC552-]": keep killing the yetis until Helcular's Rod drops (it's a very low drop rate).  Also, just outside of the cave finish "Elixir of Pain [QC501-]": kill/loot the Starving Mountain Lions (#3 on map).

01) Go SW back to the yeti cave (46.32) and start doing the next part of "Helcular's Revenge [QC553-]": charge 2 of 3 Flames (for now).  Go right as you enter the cave for the first one.  Then drop down in the cave and go north for the 2nd one.  The 3rd one will be done later in the guide.
02) Go west to the front of the house at the farm and turn in "Elixir of Pain [QT502-]" (33.35).
