Do the next step in the cave as well:

NOTE: The Flawed Power Stone item received only lasts 30 minutes, so you need to do the next few steps somewhat quickly (but you should have plenty of time).
02) While working on the following steps, also start working on "Plainstrider Menace [QC844-]" and "Raptor Thieves [QC869-]" by killing plainstriders and raptors all around the fields of the Barrens, but don't make it your main priority:
03) Go west across the main path, then go up the big mountain ramp (begins at 51.22).
04) Once you get at the top do "The Demon Seed [QC924-]": go in the small cave and use your Flawed Power Stone quest item on The Altar of Fire (48.19).
