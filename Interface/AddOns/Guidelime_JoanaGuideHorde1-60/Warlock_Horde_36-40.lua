[NX40-46 Warlock Horde]
01) Go in the Inn and make Hammerfall your new home from the Innkeeper (74.33).  Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
02) On the balcony next to you, turn in "Trollbane [QT638-]" (74.34), accept "Sigil of Strom [QA639-]".  NOTE: This quest requires a group of at least 3 players.  While out questing you can see if you can get a group to do this while in Arathi.

TIPS:  Look for the tree and rock (81.40), it shows you where the hidden path is to the cave.  If you have mining, then mine as many Lesser Bloodstone Deposits as you can.  These are used for an Alliance quest only at STV and sell good in the neutral AH.

Once done, turn it in.  Your First Aid should boost to 300 max skill.  NOTES:  You will also be revisiting this Doctor in the future to get Heavy Mageweave Bandage (240 skill), Runecloth Bandage (260 skill), and Heavy Runecloth Bandage (290 skill).  You can also destroy the Triage Bandage in your inventory as it is no longer needed.  If you were not able to do this quest yet, you will be farming more cloth in Arathi to try again later.

07) Go back to the top of the Inn (on the boat-deck) and turn in "The Bloodsail Buccaneers [QT599-]" (27.77), SKIP the next part (for now).
08) Next to you on the roof, go to the Wind Rider Master and fly to Grom'gol, Stranglethorn.
09) At Grom'gol, turn in "Mok'thardin's Enchantment [QT571-]" (32.29), accept the next part [QA573-].
10) By the Bubbling Cauldron, accept "Split Bone Necklace [QA598-]" (32.28).
11) Go in the Inn and make Grom'gol your new home (32.30).  Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
12) You should be a little over half way to level 40.  Now I grind the rest of the way to 40 on Jungle Thunderers (around 42.27) or the Venture Co. Geologists (around 45.21).  These mobs have less armor and die faster.  Instead of the grinding, you could get a 5 man group to do the Scarlet Monastery dungeon.
13) Once you are level 40, hearth to Grom'gol. 

01) Go to the Wind Rider Master (32.29) at Grom'gol and fly to Booty Bay, Stranglethorn.
02) If the boat is already at the docks then do this step at Ratchet instead:  At BB's Bank (66.44), get the following items out:  Fizzle Brassbolts' Letter, (if you can) stack of 9 Blue Pearls, (if you have them) Frost Oil, Gyrochronatom, stack of water breathing potions + Swim Speed Potions.  And if you have Healing Potion, Lesser Invisibility Potion and a Patterned Bronze Bracers get those out as well.  These items are used for easy turn-in quests in the Badlands.  And remember to not sell these items to a vender.
03) Get on the boat (26.73) to go to Ratchet.
04) Go up behind the engineering building and accept and then complete "Summon Felsteed [QT4490-]" (63.35 in The Barrens).  You now have your level 40 mount (Summon Felsteed)!
05) Go to the Flight Master at Ratchet (63.37) and fly to Orgrimmar, Durotar.
06) At Orgrimmar, go to Cleft of Shadows (48.45) to learn your level 40 spells/abilities.
07) Leave Orgrimmar south then get on the zeppelin in Durotar (51.14) to take you to the UC.  You can save some time by doing a suicide warp by jumping off of the zeppelin at a certain timing.
08) At UC, go to the Bat Handler (63.49) and fly to Hammerfall, Arathi.

Badlands Run Map:
01) Build up First Aid.  And if you are able to get to skill level 240, go talk to Doctor Gregory Victor at Hammerfall (in the building, 73.37 in Arathi Highlands) to learn Heavy Mageweave Bandage.
02) Run all the way to the Badlands...
