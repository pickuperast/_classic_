50-51 Hinterlands
01) Once at Revantusk Village, on the docks accept "Snapjaws, Mon! [QA7815-]" and "Gammerita, Mon! [QA7816-]" (80.81).
02) Turn in (if you haven't yet) "Another Message to the Wildhammer [QT7842-]" (requires the 10 Long Elegant Feathers) (79.79).  Accept "The Final Message to the Wildhammer [QA7843-]".

05) Do "Gammerita, Mon! [QC7816-]" (Elite): kill/loot Gammerita /target.  This lvl 48 Elite turtle patrols up and down the shore line.

08) Go up the path (starting at 76.62)...

01) You will be upgrading First Aid soon to either Runecloth Bandage (260 skill), and/or Heavy Runecloth Bandage (290 skill) at Hammerfall soon, so at this point make sure you have enough Mageweave Cloth to hopefully get to First Aid skill of 290.  If you need to, keep grinding the Vilebranch trolls around The Altar of Zul (around 48.67) to obtain the Mageweave Cloth you need so you can achieve this.
02) Go west to Valorwind Lake (41.59) and do "Sprinkle's Secret Ingredient [QC2641-]": under the water loot a Violet Tragan (mushroom).
03) Go NW to Aerie Peak (Alliance town) and do "The Final Message to the Wildhammer [QC7843-]": use the Final Message to the Wildhammer quest item at the well in the town (14.48).  Watch out, Alliance guards sometimes patrols past the well, so run in, plant the pike and run out when the area is clear of guards and other Alliance players.
04) Go east and clear the mobs out of the area in and around the path (around 59.51).  Work quickly to get to the next step's escort quest so these mobs are not in the way...
05) While questing in Hinterlands, you may have found an item called OOX-09/HL Distress Beacon, from it accept "Find OOX-09/HL! [QA485-]".  If so, go turn this in in the middle of the lake on top of the hill (at 49.38).  You may have already turned this in, in the past.  Then accept and do the escort "Rescue OOX-09/HL! [QC836-]" (49.38): escort the robot chicken /target all the way to the east shore.  It's important to keep aggro off of the chicken so it survives.  This quest takes roughly 16.5 minutes.  If you fail, it can be skipped.
06) Go south to Revantusk Village and turn in "The Final Message to the Wildhammer [QT7843-]" (79.79).

01) Go in the Inn and turn in "Lard Lost His Lunch [QT7840-]" (78.81).
02) On the docks, turn in "Snapjaws, Mon! [QT7815-]" and "Gammerita, Mon! [QT7815-]" (80.81).
03) Build up First Aid, and see if you need any of the following:  Heavy Mageweave Bandage (240 skill), Runecloth Bandage (260 skill), or Heavy Runecloth Bandage (290 skill).  If you meet the skill level requirements, then go to the Wind Rider Master and fly to Hammerfall, Arathi and then go to Doctor Gregory Victor at Hammerfall (in the building, 73.37 in Arathi Highlands) and upgrade what you are able to get.  NOTE:  My guide will not remind you again to to upgrade First Aid at Hammerfall!
04) Hearth to Orgimmar.  Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.  Hunters, make sure you are well equipped with bullets/arrows as you cannot get them at Blasted Lands coming up.
05) Go up to the Wind Rider Master (45.64) and fly to Valormok, Azshara.

01) Once at Valormok, Azshara, from Jediga (23.51) turn in the 3 Delivery quests:  "Magatha's Payment to Jediga [QT3562-]", "Jes'rimon's Payment to Jediga [QT3563-]" and "Andron's Payment to Jediga [QT3564-]".
02) Go north in Valormok to the Wind Rider Master (22.49) and fly to Ratchet, The Barrens.
03) At Ratchet do "Stone Circle [QC3444-]": just right outside of Liv Rizzlefix's hut (at the entrance 63.39), loot Marvon's Chest.  Also, go in Liv Rizzlefix's hut and accept "Volcanic Activity [QA4502-]".
04) Stop at Ratchet's Bank (63.38) and put the following items into it:  Violet Tragan and Stone Circle.  NOTE:  If the boat to BB is at the docks already, do this step at BB's Bank instead!
05) Go in the Inn and make Ratchet your new home (62.39).
06) Get on the boat to go to Booty Bay (at the end of the docks, 64.39).
07) Once at BB, go up to the hut (at 28.76) and turn in any Robot Chicken escort quests you have done, which include:  "Rescue OOX-22/FE! [QT2767-]" (Feralas), "Rescue OOX-17/TN! [QT648-]" (Tanaris) and "Rescue OOX-09/HL! [QT836-]" (The Hinterlands).  If you were able to turn in all of these quests, then complete and turn in "An OOX of Your Own [QT3721-]" (7,100 XP).
08) Go in the Inn and turn in "Whiskey Slim's Lost Grog [QT580-]" (27.77).
09) Go up in the Inn on the roof and from the Wind Rider Master (27.77) fly to Stonard, Swamp of Sorrows.
10) Follow the main path SW and from the Fallen Hero of the Horde (34.66) accept "The Stones That Bind Us [QA2681-]".
11) Head south into Blasted Lands...

51-51 Blasted Lands
01) As you enter Blasted Lands go to the small quest hub (at 51.14).  Accept all 5 quests there.  These 5 quests requires the following total number of items to complete them.  The items needed can drop without needing to accept the quests.  The color codes below show where the mobs are at on the images and stars represent rare mobs that may not be there. Work on the rest of this section all at once):
Mob - Total Items Needed - After "The Decisive Striker [QT2585-]" - And then "Vulture's Vigor [QT2603-]"
02) Vulture Gizzards     =14 - 12 - 2
03) Basilisk Brain         =11 - 11 - 11
04) Blasted Boar Lungs =6 - 5 - 5
05) Scorpok Pincers      =6 - 3 - 3
06) Snickerfang Jowls   =5 - 5 - 3
07) While grinding for these items, do "The Stones That Bind Us [QC2681-]": drag the different servants close to their Stone of Binding crystal next to each of them, then kill them along with attacking the crystal as well.  This allows you to actually kill the mob and get quest credit.  Each of these different servants are located at different parts of the Blasted Lands.  See map for locations.  If for some reason you cannot solo this quest, it can be skipped.
08) While grinding make sure you get everything discovered for XP (including The Tainted Scar at 44.56).
09) As you get these items, you can turn the quests in for a 60 min stat reward that will help you grind faster in Blasted Lands or even for the next section Un'Goro Crater (although they don't stack).  I recommend only showing the quests on screen that you want the rewards first.  Go to the quest hub (at 51.14, #1 on map) and turn in all 5 of these quests:  "Snickerfang Jowls [QT2581-]" (+25 Strength), "A Boar's Vitality [QT2583-]" (+25 Stamina), "The Decisive Striker [QT2585-]" (+25 Agility), "The Basilisk's Bite [QT2601-]" (+25 Intellect) and "Vulture's Vigor [QT2603-]" (+25 Spirit).  NOTE:  The follow up quests do NOT yield XP: "Rage of Ages", "Spirit of the Boar", "Salt of the Scorpok", "Infallible Mind", and "Spiritual Domination".
 
01) While questing in Blasted Lands, you may have came across an item called Imperfect Draenethyst Fragment, turn these in (at 52.36) for the quest "Everything Counts In Large Amounts [QA3501-]".  NOTE:  I have NEVER found a Flawless Draenethyst Sphere for the quest "To Serve Kum'isha [QA2521-]" ..good luck on that.  Also, the follow up quest "One Draenei's Junk" is repeatable but yields no XP.
02) Go to the border of Blasted Lands and SoS, to the Fallen Hero of the Horde (34.66 in SoS) and turn in (if you did it) "The Stones That Bind Us [QT2681-]", SKIP "Kirith".  Accept "Heroes of Old [QA2702-]".
03) Next to you on the other side of the path, turn in (if you have it) "Heroes of Old [QT2702-]" (33.66 in SoS), accept the next part [QA2701-].  Then click on the Spectral Lockbox on the ground next to you to turn it in.
04) Hearth to Ratchet.  NOTE:  If you did not do "The Stones That Bind Us", then abandon the quest.
05) Next to the Bank, go into Ironzar's Imported Weaponry to get repaired/resupplied from Ironzar (62.38 in The Barrens).  You can destroy any remaining unsellable Blasted Lands beast items you have (or bank them if you want).
06) At Ratchet's Bank (63.37), get the following items out:  Violet Tragan, Stone Circle and (if you have it) Mithril Casing (this item may be in your mailbox), this is used for a quest in Un'Goro Crater, and remember to not sell this to a vendor.
07) Go to the Flight Master and fly to Gadgetzan, Tanaris.
08) At Sprinkle (by the NW hut, 51.27), turn in "Sprinkle's Secret Ingredient [QT2641-]".  Wait a few seconds (do next step while waiting) then accept "Delivery for Marin [QA2661-]".
09) In the hut next to you, turn in "March of the Silithid [QT4494-]", accept "Bungle in the Jungle [QA4496-]".
10) Next to the AH, from Marin Noggenfogger (52.29), turn in "Delivery for Marin [QT2661-]".  NOTE:  "Noggenfogger Elixir" takes up to a minute for the NPC to make the item for you, it does not yeild any XP, so do this when you are not in a hurry (such as after level 60).  The Noggenfogger Elixir item is used for fun and can be stored in the bank when you want to use it.
11) Head south to the Broken Pillar and turn in "The Stone Circle [QT3444-]" (53.46).
12) Go SW into Un'Goro Crater (entrance at 27.52 in Tanaris)...

51-53 Un'Goro Crater
01) At the bottom of the path into Un'Goro Crater, go up the hill next to the waterfall and accept "The Apes of Un'Goro [QA4289-]" and "The Fare of Lar'korwi [QA4290-]" (72.76).
02) Go north a bit and do "The Fare of Lar'korwi [QC4290-]": loot the big Fresh Threshadon Carcass lying on the ground (69.57).  NOTE:  You must click it where the neck meets the body.
03) Grind north to the entrance of Marshal's Refuge and accept "Chasing A-Me 01 [QA4243-]" (46.13).  NOTE:  On the way to Marshal's Refuge, grind on Bloodpetal plants to start collecting Savage Fronds for a later quest.  Also start collecting crystals (the red, blue, green and yellow) scattered everywhere.  Kill/loot oozes too!
04) Go up into Marshal's Refuge and accept ALL quests there:  From the goblin on top of the hill, accept "Shizzle's Flyer [QA4503-]" (44.12).
05) Move into Marshal's Refuge (44.8) and accept "Lost! [QA4492-]", "Beware of Pterrordax [QA4501-]" (from the Wanted Sign, Beware of Pterrordax), "Roll the Bones [QA3882-]", "Alien Ecology [QA3883-]", "Expedition Salvation [QA3881-]".  NOTE:  If you have already found A Mangled Journal, accept and turn in "Williden's Journal [QT3884-]".
06) On the east side of Marshal's Refuge behind the hill, accept "Larion and Muigin [QA4145-]" (46.9).  Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
07) Time to do the Un'Goro Grind! NOTES For the Grind:
  - Don't worry about looting the Un'Goro Dirt Piles, you will find enough Un'Goro Soil from mob drops.  Also do not sell the Un'Goro Soil to vendors, you will need these for quest turn-ins!
  - Don't worry about looting the Bloodpetal Sprouts, as they are not turned in for any XP.
  - The Dinosaur Bones you need for the quest "Roll the Bones [QC3882-]" will drop from many different mobs as you do the other quests.
  - As your questing, kill/loot any Oozes (slimes) you see, and collect at least 35 Ooze samples, this is for "... and a Batch of Ooze [QC4294-]".  These Oozes are scattered all around Un'Goro Crater.
  - Also while questing, loot 7 crystals of each color (red, blue, green, and yellow) for a later quest.  These crystals are scattered all around Un'Goro Crater.
  - The Bloodpetel mobs (plants) drop Savage Fronds, you need to collect 30 of these for a later quest at lvl 59.  As you are doing the Un'Goro quests associated with these mobs you should get about half, so grind on these that you see along the way and make sure you have all 30 before leaving Un'Goro Crater.
 - Watch out for the Elite Devilsaurs patrolling around this zone.  I highlighted them through out the images so you can be alerted if you are in a danger zone for them.

LET THE GRIND BEGIN:
01) Just south of Marshal's Refuge do "Super Sticky [QC4504-]": kill/loot the Tar mobs around the tar pits.
02) Go NE to Fungal Rock and start working on "The Apes of Un'Goro [QC4289-]": kill/loot the apes (in and outside of the cave).  Also go in the cave (entrance at 64.16) and then make a right and turn in "Chasing A-Me 01 [QT4243-]", then if you have a Mithril Casing with you, accept and turn in "Chasing A-Me 01 [QT4244-]".  Then accept and do the escort "Chasing A-Me 01 [QC4245-]": escort A-Me 01 to Marshal's Refuge, and then turn it in once you get there.
03) Start working on "Larion and Muigin [QC4145-]": kill Bloodpetal Flayers around the north-middle of Un'goro Crater.  NOTE:  These mobs are also found south-middle as well, so you don't need to finish all of this now, work your way to the next step..
04) Go up on the mountain ledge (ramp entrance at 55.13) and start working on "Beware of Pterrordax [QC4501-]" along with "Shizzle's Flyer [QC4503-]": kill/loot the Pterrordax /target.  There are only 6 mob spawns here, so clear the area once and move on to the next step..

06) Do the next part of "Larion and Muigin [QC4145-]": kill Bloodpetal Lashers and Threshers around the NE side of Un'goro Crater.  Also, kill/loot any Dinosaurs you see for part of "Shizzle's Flyer [QC4503-]" (don't need to finish it now though).  Keep the next step in mind:
07) Go SE and do part of "Expedition Salvation [QC3881-]": under the tent, loot the Crate of Foodstuffs (69.36).
08) Finish up killing the Bloodpetal Flayers for "Larion and Muigin [QC4145-]" by starting below the river (around 60.47) and work you way south.

09) Grind your way SE to Torwa Pathfinder on top of the hill by the waterfall and turn in "The Apes of Un'Goro [QT4289-]" (72.76).  Accept "The Mighty U'cha [QA4301-]".  And turn in "The Fare of Lar'korwi [QT4290-]", accept "The Scent of Lar'korwi [QA4291-]".

Keep the next step in mind:
02) At The Marshlands, at the western most pond, north on it's shore, click on A Wrecked Raft (63.69) to accept "It's a Secret to Everybody [QA3844-]".  Then right next to the wrecked raft, under the water, click on A Small Pack to turn in "It's a Secret to Everybody [QT3844-]", accept the next part [QA3845-].  NOTE:  To free up bag space, do NOT loot A Small Pack yet!

04) Go west to The Slithering Scar and do "Alien Ecology [QC3883-]" along with "Bungle in the Jungle [QC4496-]": enter the cave (entrance at 50.82).  Make a left in the cave and then use your Unused Scraping Vial quest item on the mound in the center of the room.  And keep kill/looting the Gorishi bugs until you get the Gorishi Scent Gland (can drop from any of them, but has a low drop rate).  These bugs can be found in and outside of the cave.
05) Go south up at the ledges (around 56.90) to finish obtaining the Webbed Pterrordax Scales for "Shizzle's Flyer [QC4503-]" along with finishing killing the 10 Pterrordax /target you need for "Beware of Pterrordax [QC4501-]".  There is another spot of these mobs (around 45.89).

Watch out for the lvl 56 Elite mob in the cave at the top of the Ridge.  Also kill/loot the fire elementals around Fire Plume Ridge for the 9 Un'Goro Ash and to start collecting Core of Elements for a future quest (I recommend at least getting about 10 for now).
