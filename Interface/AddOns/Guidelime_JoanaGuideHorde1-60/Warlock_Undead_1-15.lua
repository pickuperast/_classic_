09) Go south in XRs and accept "The Forgotten Pools [QA870-]" (52.32).  Then next to you, get repaired/resupplied from the Clothier.
10) While working on the following steps, also start working on "Plainstrider Menace [QC844-]" and "Raptor Thieves [QC869-]" by killing plainstriders and raptors all around the fields of the Barrens, but don't make it your main priority:
11) Go NE and do "Disrupt the Attacks [QC871-]": kill the needed Razormane mobs (all around 54.27).  ALSO: Back in the Razormane camp there is a barrel called Chen's Empty Keg (56.27), loot it and accept the quest [QA819-] from the item received.
12) Go back SW to the XRs and at the orc standing at the bottom of the watchtower, turn in "Disrupt the Attacks [QT871-]" (52.30, #4 on map).  Accept "The Disruption Ends [QA872-]".  Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
