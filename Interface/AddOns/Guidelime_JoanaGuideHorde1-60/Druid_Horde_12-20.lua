And turn in "Lessons Anew [QT6126-]", accept "The Principal Source [QA6127-]".

Druid, 1e) REMINDER:  By the red canopy, from the troll Reagents and Herbs vendor, see if you can purchase any Earthroots, as you will need 5 of them for "Gathering the Cure [QC6128-]".  The item is on a limited timer, so keep checking back at him everytime you revisit the XRs.  You can also ask other players for this or check the AH next time you visit a major city.
Druid, 1f) As you do the following quests north in The Barrens, start working on part of "Gathering the Cure [QC6128-]" by kill/looting Lost Barrens Kodos around the open fields (see map):

11) Go NE to Boulder Lode Mine and do "Miner's Fortune [QC896-]" (61.5): kill/loot the mobs there until the Cats Eye Emerald drops.  NOTE:  The mobs outside of the mine can drop the emerald as well (it's a low drop rate).

Taurens Only (Orgrimmar)
If you are NOT a Tauren then skip to the next section below.
01) Taurens only run north along the river between The Barrens and Durotar, then cross the bridge to get into Orgrimmar (entrance at 64.0).
02) Once in Orgrimmar, you can stop at the First Aid Trainer (34.84) to upgrade First Aid at the Valley of Spirits.
03) Stay up and go NE, across the bridge to the Wind Rider Master (45.64) and get the FP.

02) From the zeppelin tower in Tirisfal Glades, go west around Undercity and south into Silverpine Forest.
03) Just to your right off the main path at Malden's Orchard, in the small house (56.9), accept and do the escort "Escorting Erland [QC435-]" (no exclamation mark) by escorting Deathstalker Erland SW a bit to The Ivar Patch.  Then turn it in from the NPC (53.13) in front of the big house and accept "The Deathstalkers' Report [QA449-]".  If the escortee is not there you can just skip to the next step.
04) Die on purpose and res at spirit to get to The Sepulcher.  NOTE:  Dying on purpose will clear a swim speed debuff which would otherwise hinder the next part of the druid quest!
05) Right next to where the Spirit Healer was at, click on Yuriv's Tombstone (44.43) to turn in "Until Death Do Us Part [QT264-]".
06) Just east in town get the FP from the Bat Handler (45.42).
07) Turn in (if you have it) "The Deathstalkers' Report [QT449-]" (then accept "Speak with Renferrel [QA3221-]") down in the crypt/inn (entrance at 43.41).

05) If you are level 18 you can get new spells/abilities at the Druid Trainer SW next to the Moonwell.  NOTE:  If money is tight, you can wait until level 20 to get new spells/abilities since you will have a faction rep discount then.

07) At Sergra Darkthorn turn in "Prowlers of the Barrens [QT903-]" (52.31), accept "Echeyakee [QA881-]".
08) Turn in (if it's complete) "Gathering the Cure [QT6128-]" (south in XRs, 52.32), accept "Curing the Sick [QA6129-]".  NOTES:  If "Gathering the Cure" is not complete you will be able to kill more kodos coming up.  And if you now have "Curing the Sick [QC6129-]" then you can start working on that by using the Curative Animal Salve quest item on Sickly Gazelles that you may run across scattered around northern barrens (but continue on with the quests below while doing this).  Also if you are speedrunning solo and/or have no plans to do dungeons until level 26 then "Curing the Sick" can be skipped as it may not be worth the time/xp, or the reward it ultimately gives, since Abolish Poison replaces it at level 26.
09) Go up the watchtower and turn in "Harpy Lieutenants [QT875-]", accept "Serena Bloodfeather [QA881-]".

06) Turn in (if it's done) "Chen's Empty Keg [QT821-]" (male orc next to the Plate-n-Chain hut, 62.38), accept the next part [QA822-].  If it's not done yet, don't worry.
07) Go west of Ratchet, and do "The Stagnant Oasis [QC877-]": click on the Bubbling Fissure down in the lake (56.43).
08) Go west a bit and do "Verog the Dervish [QC851-]": by kill/looting Verog the Dervish (spawns at 53.42, /target).  NOTE:  Verog spawns in randomly when a centaur has been killed around the area, and there will be a yell notice to let you know he spawns in.  Also, make sure "Centaur Bracers [QC855-]" is finished.
Druid, 8a) This is the last chance to finish "Gathering the Cure [QC6128-]": there is a few Lost Barrens Kodos around The Stagnant Oasis you can grind.  And in XRs at the next step you can see if you can get the rest of the Earthroots from the troll Reagents and Herbs vendor.
09) Go to XRs and turn in "The Stagnant Oasis [QT877-]" (south in XRs, 52.32), accept "Altered Beings [QA880-]".  NOTE:  If the Dried Seeds is still in your bags, you can destroy it, as it now has no use.
Druid, 10) Once again:  Turn in (if it's complete) "Gathering the Cure [QT6128-]" (south in XRs, 52.32), accept "Curing the Sick [QA6129-]".  NOTES:  If you are speedrunning solo and/or have no plans to do dungeons until level 26 then "Curing the Sick" can be skipped as it may not be worth the time/xp, or the reward it ultimately gives, since Abolish Poison replaces it at level 26.
11) Next to the Inn, turn in (if it's complete) "Raptor Thieves [QT869-]" (52.30), accept "Stolen Silver [QA3281-]".
12) At the bottom of the watchtower, accept "Report to Kadrak [QA6541-]" (52.31).
14) Get repaired/resupplied NW in XRs at the Forge/blacksmith area (51.29).

01) Go west from XRs to the orc at the burrow and turn in "Verog the Dervish [QT851-]" and (if you still need to) "Centaur Bracers [QT855-]" (45.28), accept "Hezrul Bloodmark [QA852-]".
Druid, 1a) If you are doing "Curing the Sick [QC6129-]": then keep an eye out for Sickly Gazelles and use the Curative Animal Salve quest item on them scattered around northern barrens, while doing this continue on:
02) Grind your way north to The Dry Hills (harpy camp) and do "Serena Bloodfeather [QC876-]": far back in the camp, kill/loot Serena Bloodfeather (39.12, /target).
03) Go east (grind mobs along the way) and do "Echeyakee [QC881-]": use your Horn of Echeyakee quest item at the kodo bones (55.17), then kill/loot Echeyakee /target (See Video).  Also make sure "Raptor Thieves [QC869-]" is finished now (kill/loot raptors).
Druid, 3a) IF you have "Curing the Sick [QT6129-]" finished, then use your Teleport: Moonglade spell and then in the building in front of you at Moonglade turn this in, accept "Power over Poison [QA6130-]".  NOTE:  If "Curing the Sick [QC6129-]" is almost finished then you may want to focus on finishing it right now, otherwise you will have a 2.5 minute flight later from TB to XR if you don't.  If not you will have more Sickly Gazelles coming up later to finish this.
04) Hearth to XRs.  Get resupplied in the Inn.
05) At Sergra Darkthorn, turn in "Echeyakee [QT881-]" (52.31), accept "The Angry Scytheclaws [QA905-]".
06) Next to the Inn, turn in (if you still need to) "Raptor Thieves [QT869-]" (52.30), accept "Stolen Silver [QA3281-]".
07) Go to the top of the watchtower and turn in "Serena Bloodfeather [QT876-]" (52.31).  Accept "Letter to Jin'Zil [QA1060-]".
08) Go SW to The Lushwater Oasis and do "Altered Beings [QC880-]" along with "Hezrul Bloodmark [QC852-]": kill/loot the Oasis Snapjaw (turtles) in and around the lake (55.42).  Also kill/loot Hezrul Bloodmark /target, he patrols clockwise around the lake.  TIPS:  Try to avoid the gray lvl mobs.  If you can't find Hezrul in time, the quest can be skipped.
09) Go SE to the Raptor Grounds and do "Stolen Silver [QC3281-]" along with (if you still need to) "Raptor Horns [QC865-]": kill/loot raptors and loot the Stolen Silver chest (58.54). (See Video)
10) Go NW and do "The Angry Scytheclaws [QC905-]" (around 52.46): kill/loot raptors for Sunscale Feathers, then use them at the 3 Raptor nests.  Make sure "Raptor Horns [QC865-]" is complete now as well.

01) Go south (around 50.53) and see if a lvl 22 gray kodo named Lakota'mani  /target  is there and kill/loot him.  He might also be on the left side of the main path (around 47.51).  He drops Hoof of Lakota'mani which starts "Lakota'mani [QA883-]", accept it if you can spot him soon.  Keep the next step in mind:
02) Just west of you at Agama'gor do "Tribes at War [QC878-]" along with "Consumed by Hatred [QC899-]" (around 43.46): kill/loot the Bristlebacks (Quilboar).  The Geomancers are north in the area, Thornweavers are in the middle and Water Seekers are south.  If you go to the area east of the main path they are evenly spaced out there.
03) Go to Camp Taurajo and accept "Weapons of Choice [QA893-]" (by the Forge, 45.57).  Get resupplied while in town.  NOTE:  Don't sell your Blood Shards to a vendor.
04) Turn in (if you have it) "Lakota'mani [QT883-]" (45.59).  NOTE:  If you hit level 20 before leaving CT, then accept "Melor Sends Word [QA1130-]" from this NPC.
05) Go to the quilboar in the cage and turn in "Tribes at War [QT878-]" (45.59).  Accept "Blood Shards of Agamaggan [QA5052-]" and then talk to the NPC to turn it in. Then accept "Betrayal from Within [QA879-]"  NOTE:  You can turn in Blood Shards for ability boosts here.  You can turn in multiple and they will stack.  Save Blood Shards for later (I recommend storing them in the mailbox and use some for the next step).
06) At this point, make sure you are at least 5 bars away from level 20.  If you aren't then I recommend grinding on Bristlebacks (Quilboar) to obtain Wool Cloth so you can get skill 115 for Heavy Wool Bandage sooner.  You can also grind on beasts around where Lakota'mani is at (47.51, #1 on map).  You can use some Blood Shards to help the grind.  NOTE:  Instead of the grinding, you could get a 5 man group and do the Wailing Caverns instance (46.36).
07) From CT, fly to XRs (or run there if you are close by).

01) Next to XR's Inn, turn in "Stolen Silver [QT3281-]" (52.30).
02) At Sergra Darkthorn turn in "The Angry Scytheclaws [QT905-]" (52.31), accept "Jorn Skyseer [QA3261-]".
03) South in XR's, turn in "Consumed by Hatred [QT899-]" (52.32).
04) Across the path, turn in "Altered Beings [QT880-]" (52.32), accept "Hamuul Runetotem [QA1489-]".  Make sure you are level 20 now and repaired/resupplied next to you at the Clothier.
Druid, 3a) Last chance for finishing "Curing the Sick [QT6129-]".  If finished, then use your Teleport: Moonglade spell and then in the building in front of you at Moonglade turn this in, accept "Power over Poison [QA6130-]".  Then Hearth to XRs.
05) Go to the Wind Rider Master (52.30) and fly to Thunder Bluff, Mulgore.

[Druid-] Thunder Bluff
01) As you do the following steps in TB keep an eye out for Bluff Runner Windstrider  /target  and accept "The Ashenvale Hunt [QA6382-]" from him.  He patrols around TB, see patrol path on map:
02) Turn in (if you have it) "Melor Sends Word [QT1130-]" (on The Hunter's Rise, 62.81), then accept "Steelsnap [QA1131-]".
03) Go NE to the Elder Rise and from the Druid Trainer Turak Runetotem turn in "Aquatic Form [QT31-]".  You now have Aquatic Form (Shapeshift)!  Also turn in (if you have it) "Power over Poison [QT6130-]" (you then learn Cure Poison).  Also get your level 20 spells/abilities from your trainer.
04) CAT FORM NOTES:  Learning Cat Form at level 20 is a very powerful new ability for Druids.  It is wise to Respec your talents for Feline Swiftness now (at a Druid Trainer) if you are not already feral so Cat Form will be more effective.
05) Next to you in the same room, turn in "Hamuul Runetotem [QT1489-]" (78.28), accept "Nara Wildmane [QA1490-]".
06) Next to you in the same room, turn in "Nara Wildmane [QT1490-]" (75.32), SKIP "Leaders of the Fang" (WC Dungeon).
07) Make sure "The Ashenvale Hunt [QA6382-]" is accepted from Bluff Runner Windstrider  /target .  He patrols around TB, see patrol path (#1 on map).
08) Above The Spirit Rise, upgrade First Aid from the First Aid Trainer (30.21) if you need to.  NOTE:  You need skill 80 for Wool Bandage and skill 115 for Heavy Wool Bandage.
09) Hearth back to XRs.  If Hearthstone is still on a cooldown you will have to go to the Wind Rider Master (47.50) at the totem tower and then fly to Ratchet and skip the first step in the next section.

01) Go to XR's Wind Rider Master (52.30) and fly to Ratchet (east of XRs).
02) By Ratchet's Bank, turn in (if you still need to) "Raptor Horns [QT865-]" (62.37).  Accept (if you haven't yet) "Deepmoss Spider Eggs [QA1069-]".
03) Turn in (if you still need to) "Chen's Empty Keg [QT821-]" (male orc next to the Plate-n-Chain hut, 62.38), accept the next part [QA822-].
04) Go south of Ratchet and do "The Guns of Northwatch [QC891-]": kill/loot the mobs at Northwatch Hold (entrance is at 60.55), and kill the 3 named mobs, listed below:
05) Go up in the tower (62.55) and kill Captain Fairmount /target.  NOTE:  SKIP the escort quest at the bottom of the tower (not worth xp/time).
06) Go up to the other tower (63.57) and at the top kill Cannoneer Smythe.
07) Go over to the top of the last tower (60.55) and kill Cannoneer Whessan.
08) Hearth to XRs.  Or if Hearthstone is still on a cooldown, die on purpose and then turn in "The Guns of Northwatch [QT891-]" (up at 62.39) then fly to XRs (Flight Master is at 63.37 in Ratchet).  Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
09) Go west from the XR's to the orc in the burrow and turn in (if you did it) "Hezrul Bloodmark [QT852-]". NOTE:  SKIP "Counterattack!" (requires group and can fail or take to long for xp/time).
