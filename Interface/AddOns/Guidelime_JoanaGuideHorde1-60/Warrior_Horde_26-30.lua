[NX30-36 Warrior Horde]
01) Once you land at Splintertree Post, next to you from the female goblin on the box, accept "Satyr Horns [QA6441-]" (73.62 in Ashenvale).
02) Next to the Inn, accept "Stonetalon Standstill [QA25-]" (74.60).
03) Go in the Inn and make Splintertree Post your new home from the Innkeeper (74.61).  Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
04) At the outskirts of Splintertree Post, accept "Ashenvale Outrunners [QA6503-]" (71.68).
05) Just south of Splintertree Post, kill the first of the three mobs related to the Ashenvale hunt: Sharptalon /target.  This lvl 31 blue hippogryph (patrols around and spawns at 75.70).  This mob drops an item, which starts "Sharptalon's Claw [QA2-]", accept it.  TIP:  An easy way to kill this mob is to bring his health to a 3rd left, then drag him into the guards at Splintertree Post, they will finish em.
06) Just south of Splintertree Post, do "Ashenvale Outrunners [QC6503-]": kill 9 Ashenvale Outrunners /target.  Try to avoid the slime mobs, as they have a nasty debuff against Warriors.
07) Go slightly west and do the escort quest "Torek's Assault [QC6544-]" (starts at 68.75): escort Torek /target & his raiders west into the Silverwing Outpost.
08) Go west to Mystral Lake and do "Stonetalon Standstill [QC25-]": kill the Befouled Water Elementals around the lake and discover the gazebo on the small island in the middle of the lake (49.70).  Also, make sure you find and kill/loot Tideress /target, this water elemental patrols around under the lake, he drops an item which starts "The Befouled Element [QA1918-]", accept it.
09) Kill the next mob related to the Ashenvale Hunt: Ursangous /target, this bear patrols clockwise around the mountain and trees (43.67).  He drops an item, which starts "Ursangous's Paw [QA23-]", accept it.
10) Kill the last mob related to the Ashenvale Hunt: Shadumbra /target, this black panther patrols around (57.56).  This cat drops an item, which starts "Shadumbra's Head [QA24-]", accept it.
11) Do "The sacred Flame [QC1195-]".  First kill/loot the Laughing Sisters around Raynewood Retreat (59.55) until you get an Etched Phial (low drop rate), then see next step...
12) Use the quest item Etched Phial at the Moonwell down south (60.73).

01) Hearth (or run back) to Splintertree Post.
02) Right outside the Inn on your left turn in the 3 Ashenvale Hunt quests: "Sharptalon's Claw [QT2-]", "Ursangous's Paw [QT23-]" and "Shadumbra's Head [QT24-]" (74.62).  Then accept and complete "The Hunt Completed [QT247-]".
03) Next to the Inn, turn in "Stonetalon Standstill [QT25-]" and "The Befouled Element [QT1918-]" (74.60), accept "Je'neu of the Earthen Ring [QA824-]".  Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
04) At the orc next to the western watchtower, turn in "Torek's Assault [QT6544-]" (73.63).
05) At the Wind Rider Master, fly to Zoram'gar Outpost, Ashenvale.
06) At Zoram 'gar Outpost, first accept "Vorsha the Lasher [QA6641-]" (starts in front of the bigger tent, 12.34) (IMPORTANT:  This starts an escort.  If he is not there you can try later in the guide.  Do the next few steps quickly in the village before following Muglash for the escort:
07) turn in "Je'neu of the Earthen Ring [QT824-]" (12.34).
08) From the troll up in the other tent, accept "Troll Charm [QA6462-]".
09) From the orc next to the Cauldron accept "Between a Rock and a Thistlefur [QA216-]".
10) Do the escort you previously accepted (if you were able to) "Vorsha the Lasher [QC6641-]": follow and protect Muglash /target until you can click on the Naga Brazier, then after a few waves of Naga mobs, kill Vorsha the Lasher. (See Video).
11) Grind your way to the Thistlefur Hold cave (entrance is 39.31) killing mobs for "Between a Rock and a Thistlefur [QC216-]".  Also, before getting to the cave, make sure Rorgish Jowl /target is dead.  He is a rare mob that patrols around (before the cave entrance) making your future escort quest difficult.  He has a 5.5 hour respawn.
12) In the cave do "Troll Charm [QC6462-]": loot the Troll Chests on the ground..  Then, in the back of the cave, from the white bear in the cage (41.34), accept and try to do the escort quest "Freedom to Ruul [QC6482-]".  You may have to fight 3-5 mobs at once several times, if you fail then it can be skipped.  You'll have to use Retaliation on the big wave at the entrance of the tunnel.  You can also fear them and bandage if you really get into trouble.

01) Make sure "Between a Rock and a Thistlefur [QC216-]" is finished, then go back to Zoram Strand and turn in "Vorsha the Lasher [QT6641-]" (12.34).  NOTE:  If you didn't do "Vorsha the Lasher" previously you can try now. 
(click to show instructions):
02) At the orc next to the Cauldron, turn in "Between a Rock and a Thistlefur [QT216-]" (12.34).
03) Up in the tent, turn in "Troll Charm [QT6462-]" (12.35).
04) Hearth to Splintertree Post.
05) In the Inn, turn in (if you did it) "Freedom to Ruul [QT6482-]" (74.61).  Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
06) At the outskirts of Splintertree Post, turn in "Ashenvale Outrunners [QT6503-]" (71.68).
07) Go up in the building at Raynewood Retreat and try to do "Ordanus [QC1088-]": kill/loot Keeper Ordanus (62.51).  Just kill the guy, grab his head and jump out of there to the right!  Make sure you have enough health to take the fall damage, (See Video).  This quest is extremely difficult to solo for warriors (barely possible).  If you can't find help you can attempt it.  You'll need a Healing Potion and some luck.  Be careful on the second floor.  You will have to use cooldowns here, especially fear/bandage.  SAVE Retaliation for the top floor.  Sit and wait for Intimidating Shout to come off cooldown if you used it on the second floor.  At the top, charge in and immediately Retaliation and Bloodrage.  Focus down Ordanus, don't cleave.  When he summons his Treants, use Intimidating Shout to get the other satyrs off you.  As soon as Ordanus dies, loot his head.  You will likely die as well.  Depending on your next move, it may be faster to take rez sickness!
08) Go east to Satyrnaar (82.52) and do "Satyr Horns [QC6441-]": kill/loot the Satyr mobs.
09) Run back to Splintertree Post (don't hearth) and turn in "Satyr Horns [QT6441-]" (73.61, #5 on map).
10) Next to you at the Wind Rider Master, fly to Sun Rock Retreat, Stonetalon Mountains.	

27-28 Stonetalon Mountains
01) Once at Sun Rock Retreat, at the blood elf, turn in (if you did it) "Ordanus [QT1088-]" (46.60), SKIP "The Den" (Group quest).
02) From the tauren next to the Inn, accept "Bloodfury Bloodline [QA6283-]" (47.61).
03) Go in the Inn next to you and make Sun Rock Retreat your new home from the Innkeeper (48.62).
04) Go to the path SW in Sun Rock Retreat and continue following it SW into The Charred Vale and do "Bloodfury Bloodline [QC6283-]" (Elite): kill Bloodfury Ripper (lvl 26 elite, 31.62, /target) (See Video).  This quest is generally not soloable for Warriors.  You would need the help from 1-2 other players for this.  If you cant find help then skip it.
05) Make sure you are at least 2 bars away from level 28 (or 1 bar away if you did not kill Bloodfury Ripper).  Grind on any mobs at The Charred Vale until you are.  Then Hearth to Sun Rock Retreat.
06) Just outside of the Inn, turn in "Bloodfury Bloodline [QT6283-]" (47.61).
07) Go to the Wind Rider Master (45.60) and fly to Thunder Bluff, Mulgore.
08) East at the Bonfire, turn in "The Sacred Flame [QT1195-]" (55.51 in TB), accept the next part [QA1196-].
Warrior, 8a) If you have a bit over 3 gold to spare, you can go just south into Ragetotem Arms and from the Axe Merchant (54.57), purchase a Merciless Axe (if it's available).
09) Get your level 28 spells/abilities.  The Warrior Trainers are on The Hunter Rise (59.87).
10) Go to TB's Inn and make Thunder Bluff your new home from the Innkeeper (46.65).
11) If you still need to upgrade to Heavy Wool Bandage (requires First Aid skill 115), then go to the top of The Spirit Rise to the First Aid Trainer (30.21) to get that.  You don't necessarily need to learn Silk Bandage yet, as you can save your Silk Cloth until you get the book to advance to Expert First Aid later.
12) Go to the Wind Rider Master at the top of the tower in the middle of TB (47.50) and fly to Freewind Post, Thousand Needles.

28-29 Thousand Needles
01) In the Inn, turn in "The Sacred Flame [QT1196-]" (46.52 in Thousand Needles), accept the next part [QA1197-].  Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.  REMINDER:  check the Lorekeeper vendor Montarr (45.51) for Liferoot.  You will eventually need to collect 8 of them for the Whirlwind Axe questline in the early 30s.  You can also check the AH for this item too.
02) Take the Lift down from Freewind Post and then go to the cave north (entrance is at 44.37) and do "The Sacred Flame [QC1197-]": keep hugging the left side of the cave until you get to the Ancient Brazier, then loot it (See Video).  Save Retaliation for the two Flame Guards if you have to. Ranged reset one of them while you kill the other if possible.  Grouping is encouraged.
03) REMINDER:  Keep an eye out for the Galak Messenger /target and kill/loot this centaur when you see him in 1k Needles.  He has a very large patrol path.  He drops an item which starts "Assassination Plot [QA4881-]", accept it (if you can).  But, don't intentionally do this yet, continue on with the next step...
04) Grind west to Whitereach Post (21.32) and turn in "Serpent Wild [QT4865-]", accept "Sacred Fire [QA5062-]".  And next to you, accept "Hypercapacitor Gizmo [QA5151-]".  NOTES:  If you have already killed Galak Messenger /target and accepted the quest from the item he dropped, then turn in "Assassination Plot [QT4881-]", then accept, do & turn in the easy follow up escort quest.  You can also get resupplied here from Laer Stepperunner.
05) Go east to the Boiling Pool (35.35) and do "Sacred Fire [QC5062-]": loot the Incendia Agave from the ground and under the water.  Try to only fight the Scalding Elementals, as they don't reduce your hit chance like the Boilings do.
06) Go west and do "Steelsnap [QC1131-]": kill/loot Steelsnap /target.  This hyena patrols counter-clockwise around a somewhat large circle (starting at 18.26) and has two bodyguards.  Original spawn is in Camp E-thok (17.19). (See Video)
07) If you are still working on "A New Ore Sample [QC1153-]", then see if you can find the Ore Sample: kill/loot the Gravelsnout Surveyors /target (there are two spawns nearby to check) for the Unrefined Ore Sample (see map for locations).
08) Go to the Highperch (entrance is 13.34) and do "Wind Rider [QC4767-]": loot the Highperch Wyvern Eggs from the ground.
09) In Highperch, go up the mountain ramp (14.40).  Once up there watch out for Heartrazor /target (a patrolling rare elite with a 12 hour respawn) and then accept and do the escort quest there "Homeward Bound [QC4770-]".  You can have the escort try to help you kill the rare elite.  If you fail, then this escort can be skipped.
10) Once again, if you are still working on "A New Ore Sample [QC1153-]": kill/loot the Gravelsnout Surveyors /target (there are two spawns nearby to check) for the Unrefined Ore Sample (see map for locations, #7 on map).

Thunder Bluff
01) Hearth to Thunder Bluff.
02) Go to The Hunter Rise and turn in "Steelsnap [QT1131-]" (61.81).  Accept "Frostmaw [QA1136-]".
03) If you haven't got all your level 28 spells/abilities you need yet, do so now. 
04) Go to The Elder Rise and turn in "Sacred Fire [QT5062-]" (70.31).  Accept "Arikara [QA5088-]".
05) Go to the Wind Rider Master at the top of the tower in the middle of TB (47.50) and fly to Freewind Post, Thousand Needles.
06) Right when you land back at Freewind Post, turn in "Wind Rider [QT4767-]" (45.49 in Thousand Needles). 
07) Go in the Inn (46.52) and make Freewind Post your new home.
08) Next to you in the Inn, turn in "The sacred Flame [QT1197-]".  Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.

01) Go up the mountain ramp (starting at 31.37) that allows you to enter Darkcloud Pinnacle at the top...
02) Once you get to the top do "Grimtotem Spying [QC5064-]": loot the three Document Chests for the secret notes.  For Secret Note #1, cross the bridges up in Darkcloud Pinnacle until you get to the Document Chest (32.33) and loot it.  For the other two, see next steps...
03) Secret Note #2 is in the hut (34.40).
04) Secret Note #3 is in the hut (39.41).
05) Go over to the other pinnacle (up at 38.35) and do "Arikara [QC5088-]" (Elite): click on the Sacred Fire of Life in the middle of the pinnacle, then kill/loot Arikara (lvl 28 elite). (See Video)
06) Stay up and go north (to 38.27) then do "Wanted - Arnak Grimtotem [QC5147-]": kill/loot Arnak Grimtotem /target.
07) Do the escort "Free at Last [QC4904-]" (same area, 38.26, #6 on map): escort Lakota Windsong /target all the way out of Darkcloud Pinnacle.
08) Go to Whitereach Post (21.32) and turn in "Homeward Bound [QT4770-]" and "Arikara [QT5088-]".  You can also get resupplied here from Laer Stepperunner.
09) You should be level 29 by now, if not grind to level 29, I grind away at centuars around Camp E'Thok (18.23) or wyverns at Highperch (entrance is 14.34).
10) Do "Hypercapacitor Gizmo [QC5151-]" (Elite): clear the mobs around the Panther Cage (23.24), open the cage and kill the lvl 30 elite panther.  Warriors, unfortunately without help this quest is near impossible to solo, so you may need to skip it.
11) This is your last chance to kill/loot the centuar Galak Messenger /target.  He has a very large patrol path (see map).  He drops an item which starts "Assassination Plot [QA4881-]", accept it.  If you can't find him in time, then skip it along with the follow up quest.
12) Go to Whitereach Post (21.33, #8 on map) and turn in "Hypercapacitor Gizmo [QT5151-]".  Also turn in (if you did it) "Assassination Plot [QA4881-]", accept and do the easy and short escort "Protect Kanati Greycloud [QC4966-]", then turn it in.
Warrior, 12a) If you are less than 10 bars (half way) from level 30, then keeping grinding until you are at least 6,900xp away from level 30 (or 4,650xp if you didn't do the "Free at Last" escort).  You can grind at centaurs around Camp E'Thok (18.23) or wyverns at Highperch (entrance is 14.34).  If you are more than 10 bars away then we will reach level 30 by questing in Hillsbrad by continuing on with the guide.

01) Hearth to Freewind Post.
02) In the Inn, turn in "Free at Last [QT4904-]" (46.52).
03) Just outside the Inn, turn in "Grimtotem Spying [QT5064-]" and "Wanted - Arnak Grimtotem [QT5147-]" (56.51).
04) Go to the Wind Rider Master (north in Freewind Post, 45.49) and if you have "A New Ore Sample [QT1153-]" finished fly to Camp Taurajo, The Barrens to turn it in.  Then, (or otherwise) fly to Orgrimmar, Durotar.  NOTE:  Taurens will most likely need to fly to XRs and then run to Orgrimmar.
05) Once at Orgrimmar, (if for some reason you are already level 30) go get new spells/abilities.    IF YOU ARE LVL 30 (if not you will do this later in the guide):  Train Rend R4 and skip the rest.  Accept the Warrior quest "The Islander [QA1718-]" from Sorek (80.32).  It's time to begin the daunting, but immensely rewarding, quest for your Whirlwind Axe.  Next, go check the AH for a few items.  First, you need 8 Liferoot.  If you bought some from the vendor in the 1k Needles before, buy what you need to get you to 8 total.  Now, search for 8 Burning Charms, 8 Cresting Charms, and 8 Thundering Charms.  If there aren't enough up there or you don't have enough money (both of which will be likely), check back a little later.
06) Go in the Inn and make Orgrimmar your new home from the Innkeeper (54.68).
07) Go to the Bank (50.70) and put the following item into it:  Kodo Skin Scroll.  And get out (if you have it) Swim Speed Potions, you can get these from the AH as well.
Warrior, 7a) IF YOU ARE LVL 30:  Fly to Ratchet and go south along the coast then swim east to the island and speak to Klannoc Macleod (69.49) to turn in "The Islander [QT1718-]", accept "The Affray [QA1719-]".  Go stand on the grate next to all the NPCs.  Once combat starts, fight the challengers off of the grate and away from the NPCs a little bit so you can drop combat in between mobs to eat.  Fight Big Will at full health and pop cds.  Turn in "The Affray [QT1719-]" and accept "The Windwatcher [QA1791-]".  Hearth/fly back to Orgrimmar.
08) The goal now is to go all the way to Hillsbrad Foothills.  To get there, first leave Orgrimmar at the south entrance, then get on a Zeppelin (51.14 in Durotar) to go to the Undercity.  Make sure you get on the Undercity Zeppelin and not the STV zeppelin!  You can save some time by doing a suicide warp by jumping off of the zeppelin at a certain timing.
Warrior, 8a) Go into the Undercity and get the FP from the Bat Handler (63.49). Then exit the UC.
 
29-30 Hillsbrad Foothills
01) Run all the way to Tarren Mill in Hillsbrad Foothills and get the FP there from the Bat Handler (60.19 in Hillsbrad). just follow the path shown on the map to get to Hillsbrad.  NOTES:  If you can, use a Swim Speed Potion to cross the lake.  Once you reach Alterac Mountains you can start grinding on some mobs along the way to Tarren Mill.  TIP:  Focus on killing some Snapjaw turtles along the shore and save the Turtle Meat for a later quest, I recommend obtaining at least 4 Turtle Meat before moving on (you can get more later on), and remember to not sell them to a vendor!
Warrior, 1a) IF YOU ARE LVL 30:  First, go up north of the river (while kill/looting the turtles and save all the Turtle Meat you get) to Bath'rah the Windwatcher (80.67) and turn in "The Windwatcher [QT1791-]", accept "Cyclonian [QA1712-]".
Warrior, 1b) IF YOU ARE LVL 30:  Now skip the rest of Hillsbrad down below and go to the Warrior "Cyclonian" Questline section below.

01) Go east to the vertical river running through Hillsbrad (68.21), and start working on "Elixir of Suffering [QC496-]" along with obtaining 10 Turtle Meat from the Snapjaw turtles in the river for a later quest (and remember not to sell them).  higher level spiders and bears are found east of the river.  Work your way toward the next step:
02) South at Nethander Stead (around 64.62) do "Elixir of Agony [QC509-]": loot the Mudsnout Blossoms around the farm.
03) Start working on "Elixir of Pain [QC501-]" (kill/loot cats south and west of the farm) and finish "Elixir of Suffering [QC496-]" (kill/loot bears and spiders, #1 on map).  The Spiders are everywhere, while the bears are more north of the farm along with lower level bears around Tarren Mill.

06) Go SW to the yeti cave (46.32) and do "Helcular's Revenge [QC552-]": keep killing the yetis until Helcular's Rod drops (it's a very low drop rate).  Also, just outside of the cave finish "Elixir of Pain [QC501-]": kill/loot the Starving Mountain Lions (#3 on map).

05) Go north of Grom'Gol around the various Bloodscalp Troll Ruins (around 29.20, watch out for the high lvl mobs on the way) and do your Warrior quest "Cyclonian [QC1712-]" (obtain 30 Bloodscalp Tusks) and start working on "Bloody Bone Necklaces [QC596-]" (obtain Bloody Bone Necklaces).  There is another camp of these trolls NE around (33.16).  If you are alone, focus on the trolls outside around the ruins that you can pick off one by one.  Avoid fighting the Bloodscalp Shamans as their Lightning Shields will rip you up.  I also recommend Disarming them when they hit 30% so they don't destroy you during Enrage.  If you run out of trolls to kill you can start doing the beast hunting quests at Nesingwary Expedition (35.10), but my guide will not cover that completely until later.  Do not leave the zone until you have all 30 tusks.  If you can group up or get some help, do so - this step can take awhile.
06) Check the AH again (with your ALT) to see if you still need any of the following:  8 Liferoot, 8 Burning Charms, 8 Cresting Charms, and 8 Thundering Charms.
07) BEFORE PROCEEDING:  Ask friends/guildies/randoms to help you out.  Bribe them if you have to.  The elementals you'll be killing next are in the upper 30's and you cannot solo them without massive amounts of luck.  There is also a level 40-43 Elite elemental to kill so a group of 5 with a healer (or some very high level friends) is essential.  If you can't get a group then continue on with the 30-40 guide until you are able to get one, then come back to these steps to continue working on obtaining your Whirlwind Axe.
08) Go back to Grom'Gol and get on the Zeppelin to go to the UC, (up in the Inn, 32.29).  You can do a suicide warp by jumping off of the zeppelin at a certain timing.
09) At the UC, go to the Bank in the middle of UC and put the following item into it: Bloody Bone Necklaces.  Also abandon the quest "Bloody Bone Necklaces" (to increase quest log space).
10) Go to the Bat Handler and fly to Tarren Mill, Hillsbrad.
11) If you have all the Charms you need then skip to the (Defeat Cyclonian) section below.  If you were NOT able to obtain all the Charms mentioned previously and you have a group with you, then head east on the main path to enter Arathi Highlands with your group and do the next section to make sure you obtain all the Charms you need:

Warrior GROUP (obtaining Charms)
01) At the Circle of West Binding (around 25.30) kill/loot Burning Exile (fire elementals) for the 8 Burning Charms.
02) At the Circle of Outer Binding (around 52.51) kill/loot Thundering Exile (air elementals) for the 8 Thundering Charms.
03) At the Circle of East Binding (around 67.30) kill/loot Cresting Exile (water elementals) for the 8 Cresting Charms.
04) Once all Charms are obtained, go east to the Horde town Hammerfall and at the Wind Rider Master (up at 73.33) fly to Tarren Mill, Hillsbrad.

Warrior GROUP (Defeat Cyclonian)
01) With your group, go north along the river and do the last part of "Cyclonian [QC1712-]": click on Bath'rah's Cauldron (79.67 in Alterac Mountains) to exchange all your Charms for the Essence of the Exile.
02) When you are ready to fight the lvl 40-43 Elite elemental, then next you in the hut, turn in "Cyclonian [QT1712-]", accept "The Summoning [QA1713-]".
03) Do "The Summoning [QC1713-]".  After accepting this, Bath'rah the Windwatcher will walk down the path and summon the Elite elemental Cyclonian, kill/loot him.  NOTES: This can be a dangerous fight.  He has a knockback on the main target, whirlwind attack, and will randomly stun others for 4 seconds.
04) Back up at the hut, turn in "The Summoning [QT1713-]" (80.67, #2 on map).  Then complete "Whirlwind Weapon [QT1713-]".  NOTE:  The Whirlwind Axe is the best choice regardless of your Horde race.
05) Head back SW to Tarren Mill and in the church building, accept (if you haven't yet) "Regthar Deathgate [QA1361-]" (63.21 in Hillsbrad).  Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
06) The goal now is to go to Hammerfall, Arathi Highlands.  If you got the FP there, then go to the Bat Handler at Tarren Mill (60.19) and fly there, otherwise head east on the main path to get there.
