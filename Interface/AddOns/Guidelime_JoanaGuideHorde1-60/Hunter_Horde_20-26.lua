Once you get to Astranaar (alliance town, #3 on map), go south of it to get around it, grind mobs along the way.

This elite has a 2 hour 45 min respawn, so he may not be there.  You can try again later at the level 25 Southern Barrens section below.
09) As you focus on the follow quests below, also start working on "Chen's Empty Keg [QC822-]" by kill/looting the Stormhides, Greater Thunderhawks and kodos along the way.

You don't necessarily need to learn Silk Bandage yet, as you can save your Silk Cloth until you get the book to advance to Expert First Aid later.
08) Go up to the Wind Rider Master in the middle of TB (47.50) and fly to Splintertree Post, Ashenvale.
