[NX20-30 Warrior Horde]
01) Go back to the other Razormane camps up NE (around 57.25) and do "The Disruption Ends [QC872-]" and "Supplies for the Crossroads [QC5041-]": kill the needed Razormane mobs and loot a Crossroads' Supply Crates (there are multiple locations of these crates).  Kreenig Snarlsnout is at (59.27, /target).
02) Once done, go SE to Ratchet and accept "Raptor Horns [QA865-]" (next to Ratchet's bank, 62.38).
03) At the WANTED sign next to the bank, accept "WANTED: Baron Longshore [QA895-]" (63.38).
04) Go to the Flight Master (63.37) to get the FP, then next to you accept "Samophlange [QA894-]".  NOTE:  To free up bag space you can destroy the Control Console Operating Manual as it is not needed.

07) Turn in "Chen's Empty Keg [QT819-]" (male orc next to the Plate-n-Chain hut, 62.38), accept the next part [QA821-].  Also focus on doing this quest while throughout The Barrens by kill/looting cats, plainstriders and Thunderlizards...
08) Right outside of the Ratchet Inn, accept "The Guns of Northwatch [QA891-]" (up at 62.39).  NOTE:  At the Ratchet Inn you can buy Longjaw Mud Snapper food for really cheap.  Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
09) Follow the path south of Ratchet to The Merchant Coast and do "Southsea Freebooters [QC887-]" along with "WANTED: Baron Longshore [QC895-]": kill the needed Southsea pirates and kill/loot Baron Longshore /target, he has 3 possible spawns at the southern most tents (starting at 64.47).
10) Go back to Ratchet, and in the engineering building turn in "Southsea Freebooters [QT887-]" (accept "The Missing Shipment [QA890-]") and "WANTED: Baron Longshore [QT895-]" (63.36).
11) Go to the goblin at the docks and turn in "The Missing Shipment [QT890-]" (63.39, #6 on map), accept the next part [QA892-].
12) Go back in the engineering building and turn in "The Missing Shipment [QT892-]" (63.36), accept "Stolen Booty [QA888-]".

01) South of Ratchet again at The Merchant Coast, do "Stolen Booty [QC888-]": loot the Fragile - Do Not Drop box for the Lens (64.49).  For the boots, see next step:
02) Go SW a bit to the other small pirate camp and loot Drizzlik's Emporium box for the boots (63.50).
03) Hearth to XRs.
04) Go to the orc at the bottom of the watchtower and turn in "The Disruption Ends [QT872-]" and "Supplies for the Crossroads [QT5041-]" (52.31).
05) Turn in (if you haven't yet) "Plainstrider Menace [QT844-]" (it should be done by now) (52.31), accept "The Zhevra [QA845-]".  NOTES:  If "Plainstrider Menace [QT844-]" is not done yet, you can find a lot of Plainstriders just around the outskirts of the XRs.  Also make sure you are level 14 before continuing.
06) South in XRs, accept "Consumed by Hatred [QA899-]" and "Lost in Battle [QA4921-]" (52.32).
07) At this point, I make sure I have 3/4 six slot bags, if I don't, I buy them at the bag vendor /target (the southern most vendor in XRs, 52.32).  Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.

01) Go west of XRs (grinding on zhevra, plainstriders and raptors along the way), to the orc in the burrow and accept " Kolkar Leaders [QA850-]" and "Centaur Bracers [QA855-]" (45.28).
02) While focusing on the following quests, also kill any Plainstriders, Centaur, Raptors and Zhevra along the way, but don't make them your main focus...
03) Grind your way to The Forgotten Pools and do "The Forgotten Pools [QC870-]": discover the fissure under the water (45.23).  Also start working on (or finish?) "Fungal Spores [QC848-]": loot the Laden Mushrooms around The Forgotten Pools.
04) Do "Kolkar Leaders [QC850-]": grind your way to Barak Kodobane (43.24, /target), and kill/loot him.  NOTE:  "Centaur Bracers" does not need to be completed now.
05) Go NW to The Dry Hills and do "Harpy Raiders [QC867-]": kill/loot the harpies (around 41.19).  Watch out there is an Elite /target that wanders around in the area. Warriors, the harpies here can be tough and now would be a good time to make sure you have the Hamstring Method down good.  Be careful and use all the buffs you have against these harpies.
06) Grind your way west (at 35.28 in the Barrens) and accept "Goblin Invaders [QA1062-]" and "Avenge My Village [QA6548-]".

15-16 Stonetalon Mountains
01) Go west into Stonetalon Mountains and do "Avenge My Village [QC6548-]": kill the needed Grimtotem taurens (around 81.90).  TIP:  Kill the Grimtotem Sorcerers first as they do a lot of damage.  Use range pulling as much as you can here and be careful, try to find help if you can as this can be hard to solo for warriors.
02) Once done, go back and turn in "Avenge My Village [QT6548-]" (35.28), accept "Kill Grundig Darkcloud [QA6629-]".
03) Go back into Stonetalon, to the path that goes up into Grimtotem post (starting at 76.89).
04) Do "Kill Grundig Darkcloud [QC6629-]": kill 6 Grimtotem Brutes and also kill Grundig Darkcloud /target, he is standing on the steps outside the hut (74.86).  You will need to use range pulling on most mobs here.
05) Warriors:  This step is near impossible to solo alone, if you can't find help then skip it unless you really want to try it: Accept and do the escort quest there ("Protect Kaya [QC6523-]" 73.85 in the hut). TIPS:  Make bandages during the escort.  When reaching down to Camp Aparaje, kill the Ruffian behind the big totem before the final fight starts.  Try to keep aggro off of Kaya Flathoof, as she has low HP.   Kill the Sorcerer first that pops out during the one battle you have to fight.  If it's too hard for you, skip it.
06) Once done, go back and turn in (if you did it) "Protect Kaya [QT6523-]" (at 35.28 in the Barrens, #2 on map), accept "Kaya's Alive [QA6401-]".  Also turn in "Kill Grundig Darkcloud [QT6629-]".

16-20 Barrens
01) Grind your way to the orc in the burrow and turn in "Kolkar Leaders [QT850-]" (45.28).  Accept "Verog the Dervish [QA851-]".  Also turn in (if it's done) "Centaur Bracers [QT855-]" if not don't worry.
02) At this point, make sure "The Zhevra [QC845-]" is finished, kill/loot Zhevra while you work your way to the XRs...
03) Go to XRs and turn in all quests and accept new ones:  Turn in "Fungal Spores [QT848-]" (next to Wind Rider Master, 51.30).  Wait a few seconds then accept "Apothecary Zamah [QA853-]".   
04) Go up in the watchtower and turn in "Harpy Raiders [QT867-]" (52.31), accept "Harpy Lieutenants [QA875-]".
05) If you finished "Raptor Thieves [QT869-]", turn it in next to the Inn (52.30), accept "Stolen Silver [QA3281-]".  If not, don't worry, I will mention when it needs to be finished.
06) At Sergra Darkthorn turn in "The Zhevra [QT845-]" (52.31), accept "Prowlers of the Barrens [QA903-]".
07) South in XRs, turn in "The Forgotten Pools [QT870-]" (52.32), accept "The Stagnant Oasis [QA877-]".  Then next to you, get repaired/resupplied from the Clothier.
08) Grind your way down south (to 49.50) and do "Lost in Battle [QC4921-]" (Manrik's Wife): She's laying dead by the hut, west of the bridge.  Simply examine the Beaten Corpse.  Also as you work your way down south, grind on mobs and make sure you are at least 800xp from level 16.
09) Go south to Camp Taurajo (CT) and accept "Tribes at War [QA878-]" (quilboar in the cage at 44.59).  NON TAURENS: get the FP there next to you from the Wind Rider Master.

01) Go south (around 50.53) and see if a lvl 22 gray kodo named Lakota'mani  /target is there and kill/loot him.  He might also be on the left side of the main path (around 47.51).  He drops Hoof of Lakota'mani which starts "Lakota'mani [QA883-]", accept it if you can spot him soon.  Keep the next step in mind:
02) Just west of you at Agama'gor do "Tribes at War [QC878-]" along with "Consumed by Hatred [QC899-]" (around 43.46): kill/loot the Bristlebacks (Quilboar).  The Geomancers are north in the area, Thornweavers are in the middle and Water Seekers are south.  If you go to the area east of the main path they are evenly spaced out there.

05) Go to the quilboar in the cage and turn in "Tribes at War [QT878-]" (45.59).  Accept "Blood Shards of Agamaggan [QA5052-]" and then talk to the NPC to turn it in. Then accept "Betrayal from Within [QA879-]"  NOTE:  You can turn in Blood Shards for ability boosts here.  You can turn in multiple and they will stack.  Save Blood Shards for later (I recommend storing them in the mailbox and use some for the next step).
06) At this point, make sure you are at least 5 bars away from level 20.  If you aren't then I recommend grinding on Bristlebacks (Quilboar) to obtain Wool Cloth so you can get skill 115 for Heavy Wool Bandage sooner.  You can also grind on beasts around where Lakota'mani is at (47.51, #1 on map).  You can use some Blood Shards to help the grind.  NOTE:  Instead of the grinding, you could get a 5 man group and do the Wailing Caverns instance (46.36).

01) Next to XR's Inn, turn in "Stolen Silver [QT3281-]" (52.30).

04) Across the path, turn in "Altered Beings [QT880-]" (52.32).  Make sure you are level 20 now and repaired/resupplied next to you at the Clothier.
05) Go to the Wind Rider Master (52.30) and fly to Thunder Bluff, Mulgore.
06) At the Wind Rider Master next to you, fly to Camp Taurajo, The Barrens.
07) At CT, turn in "Jorn Skyseer [QT3261-]" (45.59), accept "Ishamuhale [QA882-]".  Also accept "Melor Sends Word [QA1130-]".
08) Follow the path west into Mulgore and as you enter on your right, die on purpose, then res at spirit.  If you are a Tauren, just fly to Thunder Bluff, Mulgore and skip to the TB section below.
09) Follow the path north and then get on a Lift (at 36.30 in Mulgore) to go into Thunder Bluff.
 
01) As you do the following steps in TB keep an eye out for Bluff Runner Windstrider /target and accept "The Ashenvale Hunt [QA6382-]" from him.  He patrols around TB, see patrol path on map:
02) Turn in (if you have it) "Melor Sends Word [QT1130-]" (on The Hunter's Rise, 62.81), then accept "Steelsnap [QA1131-]".
03) Go to your class trainer to get new spells/abilities.  The Warrior Trainers are on The Hunter Rise (59.87 in TB).  Everything is worth getting except Thunder Clap R2.
04) Make sure "The Ashenvale Hunt [QA6382-]" is accepted from Bluff Runner Windstrider /target.  He patrols around TB, see patrol path (#1 on map).  PLEASE REPORT TO ME if "The Ashenvale Hunt [QA6382-]" quest is needed to be turned in first at Ashenvale in order to open the 3 quest items from the named mobs in Ashenvale.  You would do this by going to Ashenvale later at lvl 26 without getting this quest first!  Thanks!
05) Above The Spirit Rise, upgrade First Aid from the First Aid Trainer (30.21).  NOTE:  You need skill 80 for Wool Bandage and skill 115 for Heavy Wool Bandage.
06) Hearth back to XRs.

01) Go to XR's Wind Rider Master (52.30) and fly to Ratchet (east of XRs).
02) By Ratchet's Bank, turn in (if you still need to) "Raptor Horns [QT865-]" (62.37).  Accept (if you haven't yet) "Deepmoss Spider Eggs [QA1069-]".
03) Turn in (if you still need to) "Chen's Empty Keg [QT821-]" (male orc next to the Plate-n-Chain hut, 62.38), accept the next part [QA822-].
04) Go south of Ratchet and do "The Guns of Northwatch [QC891-]": kill/loot the mobs at Northwatch Hold (entrance is at 60.55), and kill the 3 named mobs, listed below:
05) Go up in the tower (62.55) and kill Captain Fairmount /target.  NOTE:  SKIP the escort quest at the bottom of the tower (not worth xp/time).
