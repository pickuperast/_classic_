13) From Shreev at the western side of Gadgetzan, turn in "Safety First [QT1188-]" (51.27), SKIP the next part.

01) Grind your way east to the Noonshade Ruins (around 60.24) and start working on "Wastewander Justice [QC1690-]" along with "Water Pouch Bounty [QC1707-]": kill/loot the Wastewander humans.  NOTES:  Do not sell the Wastewander Water Pouches to a vendor!  Just clear the area once and continue on...

Also, keep an eye out for Caliph Scorpidsting /target, he patrols around the area and has 2 rouges following him.  This is for "WANTED: Caliph Scorpidsting [QC2781-]", and you will have another opportunity later to do this if you cannot find him now.

07) Do "Southsea Shakedown [QC8366-]" along with "Pirate Hats Ahoy! [QC8365-]": kill/loot the Southsea humans (the Southsea Dock Workers are up at 75.48).  This is a rough area for Warriors.  Use consumables, use Hamstring when needed and save Retaliation for the next step.  Any of these mobs has a chance to drop a Pirate's footlocker, which could contain an item which starts "Ship Schedules [QA2876-]", accept it if you are able to find it, if not at least grind for awhile as it might show up, otherwise it can be skipped.  Also do the following 2 steps below in this same area:
08) "Stoley's Shipment [QC2873-]": loot the Stolen Cargo up in the building (72.47).  Pull the first two Swashbucklers outside of the building and cleave. Then, kill the 3rd on the first floor.  Go up the small stairs and you'll pull all 3 in the next room - use Retaliation.
09) "WANTED: Andre Firebeard [QC2875-]": kill/loot Andre Firebeard /target in the middle of the cove (73.47).  Watch out this fight usually involves 3 adds.  (See Video).  As a Warrior, clear the area behind you and then ranged-pull Andre and start kiting backwards.  Hit him once he gets close and keep kiting until the other mobs reset but he doesn't.  If it comes to it, you can Intimidating Shout if you get extra mobs and nuke down Andre, loot him, die, and spirit rez.
10) Once all these are done, hearth to Gadgetzan.  Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.

05) At the other side of the Port, in the hut (67.24), turn in "Stoley's Shipment [QT2873-]", accept "Deliver to MacKinley [QA2874-]".  Next to you, turn in "WANTED: Andre Firebeard [QT2875-]", "Southsea Shakedown [QT8366-]" and (if you have it) "Ship Schedules [QT2876-]".
06) Go SW to the Waterspring Field (around 60.38) and do "More Wastewander Justice [QC1691-]" along with (if you still need to) "WANTED: Caliph Scorpidsting [QC2781-]": kill the needed Wastewander humans and kill/loot Caliph Scorpidsting /target, he patrols around the area and has 2 rouges following him.
07) Hearth (or run back) to Gadgetzan and at the windmill next to the Inn (52.29, #1 on map), turn in "More Wastewander Justice [QT1691-]" and "WANTED: Caliph Scorpidsting [QT2781-]".
08) Go into the Bank next to you (52.29) and put into it:  Kravel's Scheme, Stoley's Bottle, any Wastewander Water Pouches and if you have found the item called OOX-17/TN Distress Beacon, put that in your bank as well (and don't accept the quest from it yet).

Also, start collecting Long Elegant Feathers, these drop by the Frayfeather Hippogryphs more north in the area.  These are used for a later quest, and do not sell them to a vendor.  You will be able to farm more of these later, but try to focus on killing these hippos more.

06) While questing in Feralas, you may come across an item called OOX-22/FE Distress Beacon, from it accept "Find OOX-22/FE! [QA2766-]".  Then turn this in through the small cave (at 51.57) and do the escort "Rescue OOX-22/FE! [QC2767-]".  TIP:  Before doing the escort, clear the path of yetis/bears to the main path, otherwise this escort can be really tough.  Try to keep aggro off of the Robot Chicken /target, as it can die easily.  This is also a fairly long escort (12.5 minutes).  If you fail, you can try again later on in the guide at lvl 49.
