05) Go back over to the top of the Inn and then go up the steps to Baron Revilgaz on the boat-deck and turn in "Goblin Sponsorship [QT1182-]", accept the next part [QA1182-].
06) Next to you on the roof, go to the Wind Rider Master and fly to Grom'gol, Stranglethorn.
07) In Grom'gol accept the following: "The Defense of Grom'gol [QA568-]", "Mok'thardin's Enchantment [QA570-]", "Hunt for Yenniku [QA581-]" and "Bloody Bone Necklaces [QA596-]".  Make sure you are repaired/resupplied.
08) REMINDER:  The "The Green Hills of Stranglethorn" quest requires that you save any Green Hills of Stranglethorn pages you find.  These pages can drop from any humanoid mob in STV.  You will need one of each of the following pages: 1, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, and 27.  I recommend mailing them to your alt for storage.  Once your alt collects all the pages, mail them back to your main.  You can also find these pages in the AH or from other players.  You don't need to accept the quest to get the page drops, so accept and turn this in at Nesingwary's Expedition (36.11) if you get all the pages.  You will return to STV numerous times in the future for more chances to find the pages.
